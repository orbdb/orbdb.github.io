    title: "ORB: Empowering Graph Queries through Inference"
    text: "Executing queries on incomplete, sparse knowledge graphs yields incomplete results, especially when it comes to queries involving traversals. We question the applicability of all known architectures for incomplete knowledge bases and propose Orb DB: a clear departure from existing system designs, relying on Machine Learning-based operators to provide inferred query results."

    title: "Query Optimization for Inference-Based Graph DBs"
    text: "This work aims to develop a novel graph query optimizer that leverages the power of Graph Machine Learning to equip graph queries with prediction capabilities while offering approximate but timely results to complex queries. We discuss challenges, design decisions, and research avenues required in materializing this prototype."
